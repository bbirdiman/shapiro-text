 ## and here's github!
 
 i created a repository called "shapiro-text".
 
 in it, i created this file, named "phil.md".
 
 the ".md" extension means that github knows it's a markdown file,
 and will display it formatted.
 
 so, for instance, here are some bullet-lists.
 
* red
* green
* blue

+ red
+ green
+ blue

- red

- green

- blue

and here's an ordered list.

9. magic
8. kareem
7. jerry
6. wilt
