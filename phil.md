 ## and here's github!
 
 #### github offers free storage as well.
 
 i created a repository called "shapiro-text".
 
 in it, i created this file, named "phil.md".
 
 after saving it, i clicked the "raw" button to get the u.r.l., which is:
 
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbirdiman/shapiro-text/master/phil.md
 
 the ".md" extension means that github knows it's a markdown file,
 and will display it formatted.
 
 so, for instance, here are some bullet-lists.
 
* red
* green
* blue

+ red
+ green
+ blue

- red
- green
- blue


- red

- green

- blue

i'm not sure why that last one looks indented.

and here's an ordered list.

9. magic
8. kareem
7. jerry
6. wilt

since i started with 9, it used that as the starting-value.
i didn't know it would do that; i thought the numbers were immaterial.

so let's try starting with 3.

3. magic
14. kareem
22. jerry
69. wilt
